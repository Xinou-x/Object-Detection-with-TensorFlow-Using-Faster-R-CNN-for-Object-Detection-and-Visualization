# Object Detection with TensorFlow: Using Faster R-CNN for Object Detection and Visualization

This script demonstrates how to perform object detection using TensorFlow and the Faster R-CNN model. It includes the following steps:

## 1. Setup and Download
- Define paths and URLs for downloading the model and label files.
- Create necessary directories.
- Download and extract the model and labels if they are not already present.

## 2. Configuration and Model Building
- Suppress TensorFlow logging.
- Enable GPU dynamic memory allocation.
- Load the pipeline configuration file.
- Build the detection model and restore from a checkpoint.

## 3. Detection Function
- Define a TensorFlow function for detecting objects in an image.

## 4. Load and Prepare Image
- Load a local image using OpenCV.
- Expand image dimensions to match the model's input requirements.
- Convert the image to a TensorFlow tensor and perform detection.

## 5. Visualization
- Visualize the detection results by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the image.
- Save the resulting image with detections to a file.

This end-to-end example provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and using TensorFlow's object detection API with the Faster R-CNN model.
